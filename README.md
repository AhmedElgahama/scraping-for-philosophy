# scraping-for-philosophy

Using Breadth First Search Algorithm technique 
And Queue data structure 
Asking the user for the starting link scraping it and get the nested urls in it 
Saving it in a queue then each time get the first url to match it wth the target URL
If it's the target print all visited URLs
If not scrape this URL to get the nested URLs and add them to the queue
